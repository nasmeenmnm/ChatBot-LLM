A full-stack, real-time chatbot application built with Python (FastAPI) and the Google Gemini API. This project demonstrates the implementation of a responsive, streaming API for a conversational AI, paired with a simple yet effective HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend.

âœ¨ Features
Real-time Interaction: Leverages server-sent events (SSE) through FastAPI's StreamingResponse to provide a seamless, word-by-word conversational experience.

Gemini-Powered Intelligence: Utilizes the Google Gemini API to generate intelligent and contextually relevant responses.

Efficient API Design: A lean and performant backend built with FastAPI, showcasing best practices for building modern web APIs.

CORS Configuration: Fully configured to handle cross-origin requests, allowing for flexible frontend integration.

Clean Separation of Concerns: A clear distinction between the backend and frontend codebases, promoting modularity and maintainability.

ðŸš€ Tech Stack
Backend:

Python: The core language for the API.

FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building the API.

python-dotenv: For managing environment variables securely.

uvicorn: A lightning-fast ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.

Google Gemini API: The core large language model (LLM) for the chatbot's intelligence.

Frontend:

HTML5: The markup language for the web page structure.

CSS3: For styling and presentation, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.
